    <h2>My Tech Stack</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to my tech toolbox, where I've curated a versatile set of skills 
        that form the backbone of my development journey. In the world of data, 
        I wield NumPy, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Hugging Face, 
        Cryptodome Libraries, Netifaces, and SparkSQL to decode complex datasets 
        and uncover insights. When it's time to bring data to life, I turn to Plotly 
        for captivating visualizations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Navigating the cloud landscape is my forte, with Google Cloud, Firebase, AWS, 
        and Netlify as my trusted companions. Specialized AI tools like FAISS and Axios 
        bolster my capabilities, while ElasticSearch, Kibana, and Logstash keep data 
        management and analysis in check.
    </p>
    <p>
        From web development to backend prowess, I seamlessly traverse frameworks like 
        Flask, Angular, React, Node.js, and Express.js. Database management is my 
        playground, covering MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. I ensure smooth collaboration 
        with Git and GitHub, and I'm well-versed in containerization using Docker. My API 
        expertise spans RESTful and GraphQL interfaces, and I've mastered continuous 
        integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with Jenkins and Travis CI.
    </p>
    <p>
        These skills aren't just tools; they're the means through which I transform concepts 
        into functional, user-centric digital experiences. Explore my portfolio to see how 
        this tech stack translates into real-world solutions.

    <h2>My Certifications</h2>
    <p>
    In my journey of professional growth, I've embraced the opportunity to attain certifications that reflect my passion for technology and my unwavering commitment to learning. I hold the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate, showcasing my proficiency in Deep Learning with TensorFlow, Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch, Deep Learning Essentials with Keras, Machine Learning with Apache Spark, and Machine Learning with Python.
    </p>
    <p>
    Beyond certifications, I've had the privilege of participating in real-world experiences that have enriched my skill set. Among these experiences, I was honored to be selected as one of just 187 students, chosen from a vast pool of 16,000 applicants, to attend Google Cloud NEXT'23 as a student innovator. This unique opportunity expanded my horizons across a spectrum of domains, including AI-ML Ops, Generative AI, Cloud Architecture, Data Proficiency, Application Development, DevOps Engineering, Productivity Enhancement, and the Fundamentals of Generative AI.
